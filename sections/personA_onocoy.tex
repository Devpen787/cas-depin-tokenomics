\section{Empirical Case: Onocoy}
\label{sec:onocoy_case}

\textit{[INSTRUCTIONS FOR PERSON A: Please fill this section with descriptive facts. Do not analyze the token price or success yet. Focus on the business and the hardware.]}

\subsection{System Overview}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GNSS \& RTK Technology:} Explain what Real-Time Kinematics (RTK) is and why it improves GPS accuracy (centimeter-level precision).
    \item \textbf{The Physical Network:} Describe the density of stations required (e.g., 20km baseline) and why a distributed network makes sense versus a centralized one.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Network Participants}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Miners (Reference Stations):} Define the hardware requirements. Cost of entry? (e.g., \$1,000+). Install requirements? (Roof access, clear sky view).
    \item \textbf{Users (Rovers):} Who buys the data? (Surveyors, drones, agriculture machines). How do they access it? (NTRIP caster).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tokenomic Mechanics (Descriptive)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The ONO Token:} Describe the emission schedule (halving? decay?).
    \item \textbf{Burn/Sink Mechanism:} How does the system capture value? (e.g., Data Credits or burn-and-mint).
    \item \textbf{Staking Rules:} Are there staking requirements for miners to participate?
\end{itemize}
