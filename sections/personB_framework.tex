\section{Theoretical Tokenomic Framework}
\label{sec:theoretical_framework}

\subsection{Introduction}
[TODO: Define the scope of Tokenomics in DePIN. Key themes: Sustainability, Mechanism Design, and the 'Physical' constraint.]

\subsection{Comparative Scope: The Solana DePIN Ecosystem}
\label{subsec:solana_scope}
This section analyzes the tokenomic design patterns of eight leading DePIN protocols on Solana to establish a baseline for industry standards.

\subsubsection{Project Archetypes}
[TODO: Analyze the following projects based on Hardware Sunk Cost vs. Active Work:]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Helium (IoT/Mobile):} The Burn-and-Mint Standard.
    \item \textbf{Hivemapper (Mapping):} Active labor constraints.
    \item \textbf{Render (Compute):} High-end GPU economics.
    \item \textbf{io.net (Aggregated Compute):} Cluster economics.
    \item \textbf{Geodnet (GNSS):} Location NFT and hex-based capping.
    \item \textbf{Grass (Bandwidth):} Zero-marginal cost participation.
    \item \textbf{Nosana (CI/CD):} Compute grid incentives.
    \item \textbf{Aleph.im (Storage/Compute):} Infrastructure persistence.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tokenomic Building Blocks}
\label{subsec:building_blocks}
\subsubsection{Emission Schedules \& Inflation}
[TODO: Compare 'Halving' models (Bitcoin style) vs. 'Linear Decay' vs. 'Dynamic Minting'.]

\subsubsection{The Burn-and-Mint Equilibrium (BME)}
[TODO: Detailed definition of BME. How Dual-Token systems (Token + Data Credits) separate volatility from utility cost.]

\subsubsection{Work Verification Mechanisms}
[TODO: Define how 'Proof of Physical Work' is validated on-chain (e.g., Proof of Coverage, Proof of Mapping).]

\subsection{Monetization and Demand Regimes}
\label{subsec:demand_regimes}
\subsubsection{The Value Capture Funnel}
[TODO: Map the flow of Fiat -> Buy Pressure -> Burn -> Supply Reduction.]

\subsubsection{Demand Cyclicality: Enterprise vs. Consumer}
[TODO: Contrast steady B2B demand (Geodnet) vs. cyclical consumer demand (Helium).]

\subsection{Detailed Analysis of the ONO Mechanism}
\label{subsec:ono_mechanism}
[TODO: Deep dive into Onocoy's specific 'Capped Supply' architecture vs. the BME industry standard defined above.]

\subsection{Conclusion}
[TODO: Summarize the theoretical vulnerabilities identified in these models, setting the stage for the specific Empirical Stress Analysis in Section 6.]
