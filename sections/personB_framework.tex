\section{Analytical Framework: Tokenomic Design Patterns}
\label{sec:analytical_framework}

\textit{[INSTRUCTIONS FOR PERSON B: This is the comparative analysis chapter. You must frame Onocoy within the wider ecosystem of Solana-based DePINs.]}

\subsection{Comparative Scope: Solana DePIN Ecosystem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Comparative Set:} Please analyze these 8 projects: Helium, Grass, GEODNET, io.net, Hivemapper, Nosana, Aleph.im, XNET.
    \item \textbf{Comparison Table:} Create a summary table comparing them by:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Market Cap \& Sector (Compute, Sensor, Wireless).
        \item Token Model (e.g., BME vs. capped supply).
        \item Revenue Source (B2B vs B2C).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tokenomic Building Blocks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Emission Logic:} Identify common patterns. Do most projects favor early adopters aggressively?
    \item \textbf{Verification (Proof of Physical Work):} How does Helium verify coverage vs. Hivemapper verifying roads?
    \item \textbf{Value Capture (Sinks):} Analyze how these protocols burn tokens. Is it working?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Monetization and Demand Structures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Demand Regimes:} Distinguish between Enterprise Demand (stable, slow) and Consumer Demand (volatile).
    \item \textbf{The Fiat Bridge:} How does fiat money enter the system to buy tokens?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ONO Token Design Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deep Dive:} Analyze Onocoy's specific mechanism logic here.
    \item \textbf{Mechanism Critique:} How does ONO's bonding curve or emission logic differ from the standard BME model?
    \item \textit{(Note: This analysis feeds into Person C's simulation parameters in the next chapter.)}
\end{itemize}
