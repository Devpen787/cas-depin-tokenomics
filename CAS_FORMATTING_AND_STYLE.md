# CAS Transferarbeit Conventions: Formatting & Style

## 1. Purpose of This Document
*   **Flexibility**: CAS allows flexibility in formatting provided academic standards are met.
*   **Consistency**: This document locks choices early to ensure consistency across all authors.
*   **Nature**: These rules are deliberate defaults selected by the authors, not automatic corrections.

## 2. Document Layout (Chosen Defaults)
*   **Paper Size**: A4.
*   **Font Size**: 12pt.
*   **Line Spacing**: 1.5.
*   **Margins**: Approx. 2.5 cm on all sides.
*   **Page Numbers**: Enabled, consistent placement.
*   *Note: These are standard academic defaults chosen for clarity and reviewer familiarity.*

## 3. Font and Typography
*   **Main Text Font**: Computer Modern (LaTeX default).
*   **Custom Fonts**: None.
*   **Styling**: No decorative styling.
*   **Emphasis**: Italics only (no bold or colors for emphasis).

## 4. Language and Tone
*   **Language**: English (US/UK consistent throughout).
*   **Tone**: Academic, neutral, non-promotional.
*   **Avoid**: Speculative or marketing language.
*   **Verbs**: Prefer cautious verbs ("indicates", "suggests", "is consistent with").

## 5. Structure and Sectioning
*   **Numbering**: Numbered sections and subsections.
*   **Separation**: Clear separation between description, analysis, and interpretation.
*   **Ordering**: No results before methods.

## 6. Figures, Tables, and Visuals
*   **Referencing**: Every figure/table must be referenced in the text.
*   **Captions**: Every figure/table must have a caption.
*   **Source**: Must state a source ("own illustration" if applicable).
*   **Role**: Visuals support arguments; they do not replace explanation.

## 7. Citations and References (Explicit Choice)
*   **Style**: Numeric (`[1]`, `[2]`) - Standard for technical/CS-related theses.
*   **Consistency**: One style only, applied consistently.
*   **Management**: References managed via BibTeX (`bibliography.bib`).
*   **Requirement**: Every non-trivial factual claim must be cited.
*   *Note: APA is chosen as a widely accepted academic standard; CAS permits consistent styles.*

## 8. Use of External Tools (AI, Dashboards, Software)
*   **Responsibility**: AI tools may assist drafting/review, but authors remain fully responsible for correctness.
*   **Status**: AI outputs are not treated as primary sources.
*   **Software**: Simulators and dashboards are cited as tools, not evidence by themselves.

## 9. What This Document Does NOT Do
*   **No Auto-Correct**: Does not auto-correct text.
*   **No Enforcement**: Does not enforce tone or rewrite content.
*   **No Guarantees**: Does not guarantee grading outcomes.

## 10. Change Policy
*   **Stability**: These conventions remain fixed unless all authors agree to change them.
*   **Documentation**: Any change must be documented and applied consistently.
