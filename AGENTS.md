# Codex & Antigravity Agent Configuration

You are assisting with a master's level thesis on DePIN Tokenomics. 

**CRITICAL:** Before taking any action, you MUST read the `THESIS_OS.md` file located in the root of this repository. 

The `THESIS_OS.md` file contains:
1. The "Golden Thread" (the core argument of the thesis)
2. The exact terminology (e.g., we use DTSE, not ORSTE)
3. The citation and LaTeX tagging workflows (`% TODO-CITE:`)
4. The mapping of theoretical concepts to simulation code parameters.

Always ensure your output aligns with the architecture and SOPs defined in `THESIS_OS.md`.
